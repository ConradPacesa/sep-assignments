***Sort collection of 50 random ints between 1 and 100***
       user     system      total        real
Bucket sort  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000162)
Heap sort    0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000121)
Quick sort   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000184)

Looking at the bar chart, speculate on why you think some sort algorithms are
faster than others and provide rationale as to your thought process.

Some sorting algorithms are faster than others because of the number of
iterations required to sort an array. Heap sort will require O(n log n)
iterations to sort the array in a worst case scenario. Quick sort and
Bucket sort would require O(n^2) iterations to sort the array. The reason for
this difference is due to the different approaches that each algorithm takes
for sorting the collection.
